Roy is a small functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
This is a quick hack to bring a [Roy][roy] REPL into your browser. It's a mix
of Roy and the following ingredients:

* [jquery-console](https://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console)
* [Solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

It was created by [Miikka "arcatan" Koskinen][miikka]. To make it better, [open
